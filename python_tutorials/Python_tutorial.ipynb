This could be confusing some times to the new learners but it is not too difficult to understand. `a=2` tells python to allocate memory for the variable `a` whose value is 2. When you write `a=a+1`, python looks if there is a variable called `a` present in the memory, if there is, it fetches it, adds 1 to it and stores the result as the value of `a` in the memory.

Of course, it is crucial for efficiency that there be a way to catalogue and make sense of all this information. This is why we have *data types* in python. Integers, which you have seen earlier, are one example of a data type. The various data types in python are the following:\n",

The syntax for lists is the following:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "print(list1[0])\n",
    "print(list1[3])\n",

In a way, classes let you create a template for something that contains data and methods. Let's consider an example to understand the concept of classes and objects. Say, we have a solid block with length, l, breadth, b, and height, h. We can calculate its surface area using formula 2*(lb+bh+lh), and volume using formula, lbh. So, the variables in this case are, l, b, and h and the methods will be `surf_area()`, and `volume()`. Now, imagine you have multiple boxes, one approach will be to define variables like $l_1$, $b_1$, $h_1$ for box 1, and $l_2$, $b_2$, $h_2$ for box 2. And you can guess that it could get little cumbersome. As mentioned before classes let you bundle data and methods together.

    "As mentioned earlier, you only need a few basic building blocks are required in a programming language to build very complex applications. Python, just like any other programming language, has a set of 'native' operations, like the operations we talked about in this notebook. Many other more complex functionalities are provided using modules. These modules typically consist of many functions (just like the 'profit per person' function that you wrote above) bundled together into a package for the benefit of the end user. Before I spend a lot of time and effort working on my own code, I might check to see if there is a module available for python that already has this functionality ready to go! You can call the functions in a given module by 'importing' it first. Let's see the following example:"

    "Python is often referred to as the swiss army knife of programming languages, because it lets you create so many different kinds of applications. Covering all the different aspects of Python in this short tutorial is certainly not possible. However, if you understood the above tutorial, you will be able to follow the tutorials in the Qubes course. We will teach you a little more Python, and we will introduce a few more modules whenever we need it, as we go along in the Qubes course. A little sneak peek: a lot of the quantum computing coding that you will learn uses a lot of modules which are written specifically for quantum computing!"
