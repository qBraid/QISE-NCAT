    "Just like in mathematics, the use of variables is crucial in order to write statements that hold generally, as opposed to statements about specific numbers. The assignment operator in python is '='. When you write `a=2` in python, python stores in memory a variable `a` whose value is 2. Another valid operation in python is `a=a+1`. This could be confusing some times to the new learners but it is not too difficult to understand. `a=2` tells python to allocate memory for the variable `a` whose value is 2. When you write `a=a+1`, python looks if there is a variable called `a` present in the memory, if there is, it fetches it, adds 1 to it and stores the result as the value of `a` in the memory. Let's see this in action:"
