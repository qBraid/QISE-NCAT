    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. By general-purpose, we mean that it is designed for a wide variety of applications. By high-level, we mean that you do not need to know the internal workings of computers to use it. All the complicated details of computers are abstracted out, and the programming language is relatively easy to understand. Python is in fact one of the most intuitive programming languages, and often feels similar to a natural language.\n",
