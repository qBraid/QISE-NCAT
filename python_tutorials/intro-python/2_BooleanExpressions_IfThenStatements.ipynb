    "When writing a program you might want to specify that a certain piece of code should be executed *only if* a certain other condition is satisfied, and a different piece of code should be executed otherwise. To continue with the example of making coffee, the instructions should be to: turn the switch to start brewing coffee *if* the water reservoir has been filled, *else* the reservoir should be filled first. In Python, this is accomplished using `if` and `else` statements. There may be instances where you need to run a certain piece of code over and over again for a given number of times: this is possible using `for` loops. Or you may want to run a piece until a certain condition is true: this is achieved using a `while` loop.\n",

As you become more familiar with Python, you will appreciate their importance. In this section, we'll cover the `if` and `else`, saving `for` and `while` loops for another time.\n",

    "Before we do so, however, we first need to discuss another important concept. How do we tell python to check a certain condition? We'll do this using a **boolean expresion**. As we'll see, these statements always have a single value: `True` or `False`."
