    "Python's list data type is useful for many things. We can use lists to store collections of information, get elements, etc. Vectors are also a collection of numbers stored in a particular order. But **many of the functions we want to perform on vectors (i.e. the dot product, vector addition, vector multiplication, etc.) are not available natively through python lists.** However, we can use a python package that is ubiquitously used by python users: `numpy`. With `numpy`, we can do all sorts of vector calculates (and much more besides). We will only introduce you to a small fraction of the functionality provided by `numpy`, much of which requires mathematical understanding beyond the scope of this course.\n",
