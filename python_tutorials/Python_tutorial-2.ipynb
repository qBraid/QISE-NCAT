This could be confusing some times to the new learners but it is not too difficult to understand. `a=2` tells python to allocate memory for the variable `a` whose value is 2. When you write `a=a+1`, python looks if there is a variable called `a` present in the memory, if there is, it fetches it, adds 1 to it and stores the result as the value of `a` in the memory.

Of course, it is crucial for efficiency that there be a way to catalogue and make sense of all this information. This is why we have *data types* in python.

The syntax for lists is the following:\n",

    "print(list1[0])\n",
