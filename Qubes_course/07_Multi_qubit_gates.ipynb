    "\n",
    "At this point, you might be wondering: \"If applying a quantum gate to a quantum state amounts simply to multiplying a matrix and a vector, why do we need quantum computers at all? Couldn't we just compute these matrix multiplications using our laptop?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is certainly true for small numbers of qubits. However, as the number of qubits grows, things change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having seen the formalism for states of two qubits you may have some intuition for what might be the general state of $n$-qubits. A single bit has $2^1$ possible values, two bits have $2^2=4$, three bits have $2^3=8$ possible state. Generalizing this, $n$-bits have $2^n$ possible values. So, the state of $n$ qubits can be a superposition of all these $2^n$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we specified the state of two qubits using four complex amplitudes, i.e. a state of two qubits is a vector in $4$-dimensional complex space, we specify the state of $n$-qubits using $2^n$ complex amplitudes, i.e. it is a vector in $2^n$-dimensional complex space. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Compare this with a string of $n$ bits, which is specifed using just $n$ bits.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying an $n$ qubit gate to an $n$ qubit state amounts to multiplying a $2^n$ by $2^n$ matrix by a $2^n$ dimensional vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a fun calculation, if you take 400 qubits (which you can think, roughly speaking, as being 400 particles), then the general state of the 400 qubits requires $2^{400}$ complex amplitudes to be specified fully: $2^{400}$ is more than the number of atoms in the universe!! Thus, calculating the action of a quantum gate on a $400$ qubit state by multiplying matrices and vectors would be thoroughly impossible. So how can a quantum computer do it? The catch is that a quantum computer does not actually *calculate* all of the amplitudes. Rather, it merely *evolves* the quantum state of, say, $400$ particles by inducing some physical transformations on the state (these are described by quantum gates).\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, the exponential scaling of the dimension with respect to the number of qubits is one of the features of quantum mechanics that is responsible for quantum advantages in computational tasks. Beware, however, that these complex amplitudes are working *behind the scenes*, and nature does not actually allow us to access all of them. We can only gain information about a state of $n$ qubits (which is specified by $2^n$ amplitudes) by measuring it: even if we measure all of the $n$ qubits, we only obtain $n$ bits of information, not $2^n$! So taking advantage of the $2^n$ amplitudes requires delicately orchestrating the destructive and constructive interferences amongst them."
