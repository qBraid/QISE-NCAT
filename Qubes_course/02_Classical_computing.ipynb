    "When we think of computation, we generally associate it with numbers: some long calculation that involves arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication). Historically, doing these operations is what motivated people to invent computing devices. However, these primitive motives later inspired and became part of a much richer <em>theory of computation</em>. More generally, a computation is described by what is known as an *algorithm*. An algorithm is like a recipe. It is the description of a sequence of logical rules to be applied to the input to a problem (e.g. two numbers) in order to arrive at a desired result (e.g. the sum of the two numbers).\n",

    "One of the things mathematicians do is prove theorems. Finding/proving new theorems is the process of discovering/inferring new truths from axioms according to a set of rules. One of the most influential mathematicians of all time, David Hilbert (on the right), posed the question: \"Is there a mechanical <em>procedure</em> by which the truth or the falsity of a mathematical conjecture can be decided?\"\n",

    "Alan Turing (on the left), one of the founding figures of computer science, took Hilbert's question quite literally: he came up with a model of a <em>machine</em> to answer this question. Such a machine was inspired by the way mathematicians think when proving theorems: they start from axioms (statements that are taken to be true without proof), and apply logical rules to deduce new conclusions. In practice, a mathematician's mind is keeping track of and continuosly expanding a set of \"known\" conclusions, so that it can build upon what was inferred earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing abstracted the salient features of this process. He then formalized and elaborated on what may be required if the process were to be automated using <em>machines</em>, and went on to propose a detailed physical model, which is now known as a *Turing Machine*. This is a physical model of a machine which is able to implement any arbitrary *algorithm*. \n",

    "The fundamental unit of information is a *bit*, which has two possible states, 0 and 1. The bit is an abstraction of a tiny electrical component of a digital computer known as a *transistor*. The 'on' and 'off' states of a transistor correspond to 1 and 0, and it is possible for a transistor to switch between the two. You can take some time to realize that the bit is rightfully the fundamental unit of information. If you want to convey something to someone, the minimum amount you can tell them is 'yes' or 'no'. This information does not have to be verbal. For example, presence or absence of an object, the 'on' <!--683600384715  --> or 'off' state of a light bulb, the presence or absence of a sound, all represent one bit of information. We use bits of information in our day-to-day life. For example, seeing all the lights in a house tells you that no-one's home (You answered the question 'is anyone home?' using the one bit information about the lights being turned on or off). \n",

For example, with two bits, there are four possible configurations (or states) that the bits could take: 00, 01, 10, and 11. So, let's say you have to convey to a salesperson which color of a phone you want out of the four options available. In this case, since there are four possible options, you would need at least two bits of information to convey your option. The four possible options, say red, pink, grey, and black (or 1,2,3 and 4) can be mapped to configurations of two bits as follows:\n",

We know, of course, that the numbers do not stop at 9, and we can actually represent as large a number as we wish by just adding more digits.

For example, when you are adding two numerals in the decimal system, whenever the sum is greater than 9, you carry over a 1 to the next digit. Similarly, in the binary number system, whenever the sum is greater than 1, you carry over a 1. The rules, then become: <br />\n",

It is a fact that each color can be produced by combining just three colors: red, blue and green. Thus, for each tiny square in the grid, the information about its color is stored in three integers representing the intensities of the colors red, blue, and green (in turn these three integers can be stored in binary). So, when you take a picture with a 12 megapixel camera, you are actually storing values of red, blue and green for each of the 12 million pixels.

You the user send the commands for things you want to do in very simple language and the commands go through multiple levels of abstraction and finally gets converted into digital circuits which are then executed using bits and logic gates.\n",

    "High level languages like python are where you can write code for a given algorithm to accomplish certain task. Even though, we have so much computational resources available, but they are no match for some of the algorithms. As we will learn later, there are some problems in quantum mechanics which you can not solve, no matter how much computational resources you have. -->"

The NAND gate outputs $0$ only if both inputs are $1$ and $1$ otherwise. Go to [nandgame.com](http://www.nandgame.com) and play a few levels. The goal of the game is to build circuits using just NAND gates. Once you have built a circuit using just NAND gates, you can use those circuits in further levels, knowing you have already constructed them from NAND gates alone!"
