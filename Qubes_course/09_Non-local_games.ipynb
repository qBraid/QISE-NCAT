    "This is a very natural question, which deeply challenges the notion of free will, and one that you might have already wondered about yourself at some point. The reasoning behind this question is simple: if physical systems evolve according to the laws of physics (which we assume to be fixed), and if we fix the state of every particle in a system at time $t_0$, couldn't everything that happens afterwards, be derived by solving some equations? Even if these equations are too complicated to solve manually or on a supercomputer, a solution still exists, and this solution fixes the state of the system at any time $t>t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example. Imagine yourself shuffling a deck of cards, and revealing the top card. What is the probability that the top card is an ace of spades? You would typically regard this process as a probabilistic process whose outcome is a uniformly random card out of the $52$ possible cards (as long as you shuffled well enough), and you would typically answer that the probability of seeing an ace of spades is $1/52$. However, I argue that this randomness is <font size=3 color=9A11DA>not \"true randomness\"</font>: if you knew exactly the position of each card in the deck after shuffling, then you would now for sure if an ace of spades is at the top or not. The probabilistic nature of this process is thus merely an artifact of a <font size=3 color=9A11DA>lack of knowledge</font> about the system under study: you don't know the exact position of each card because they are all face down.\n",

What is the probability rolling the number $4$? We would typically say that the probability of obtaining number $4$ is $1/6$. For all practical purposes this is an excellent model, however I would argue that if you knew the exact state of every particle in your hand, in the dice, in the air etc, then it would be possible, in principle, to know for sure what the outcome of the roll will be, and thus if will be a $4$ or not.\n",

    "Some of you might be thinking: well, by the uncertainty principle we know that in quantum mechanics it is not in general possible to determine exactly both the position and the momentum of a particle. Or put in simpler quantum information terms, it is not in general possible to know exactly both the outcome of measuring a qubit in the standard basis *and* in the Hadamard basis. While this is true, however, my question to you is: how do you know that this uncertainty is a <font size=3 color=9A11DA>\"true uncertainty\"</font>, and not just an artifact of our lack of knowledge about the quantum mechanical system under study. For example, how can you be sure that there does not exist an underlying variable $\\lambda$, such that knowing $\\lambda$ fixes deterministically the answers to both a standard basis measurement and a Hadamard basis measurement of the qubit, regardless of which of these measurements is eventually executed. The answer is that by considering just a single qubit, it is not possible to exclude that there exists an underlying variable $\\lambda$ which deterministically fixes the answers to any possible future measurement of the qubit.\n",

    "Note that one does not need to *assume* that quantum mechanics is true in order to get to the conclusion that nature is not deterministic. It is sufficient to carry out the experiment above, and observe a winning probability that exceeds $3/4$. This is enough to guarantee that whatever system produced such a winning probability cannot be explained by a deterministic model. Quantum mechanics only provides a way to *realize* such an experiment.\n",
